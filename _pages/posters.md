During my time in the [NIBN Bioinformatician Unit](http://nibn.co.il/unit/bioinformatics-core-unit/) I worked on public Staphylococcus Aureus
data under the guidance of Jacob Moran-Gilad, Michal Ziv-Ukelson and Vered Chalifa-Caspi
that materialize to Posters and Articles later on.
 
The work included fetching of high number of assembly samples, building sql databases
and the analysis of the data through number of tools one of which I created my self (SSCmec complex typing).
